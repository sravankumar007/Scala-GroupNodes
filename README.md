# Scala-GroupNodes
This project implements a simple graph algorithm. A directed graph is represented as a text file where each line represents a graph edge.
For example,
10,20 represents the directed edge from node 10 to node 20.

First, for each graph node, we compute the number of node neighbors.
Then, we group the nodes by their number of neighbors and for each group we count how many nodes belong to this group.
The result will have lines such as:
11 31 
which says that there are 31 nodes that have 11 neighbors.
